# Integrating GPT3.5-based Chatbot in Online Healthcare System
Efficient and rapid access to medical resources plays an important role in the healthcare system. However, limited medical resources and long wait times for patients seeking medical care remain significant challenges.
We propose an online healthcare system that integrates the chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 model, which allows patients to schedule appointments with doctors and consult with an AI-powered chatbot for medical advice. 
It provides an alternative to the traditional healthcare services and upgrades online healthcare services. The AI-powered chatbot was found to be reliable and efficient in providing medical advice to patients. 
This system significantly improves access to medical services and provides patients with a more convenient and cost-effective way of seeking medical services.
